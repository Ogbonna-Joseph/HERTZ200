Sim68  MAX = 30mA        Sleep mode  =   14uA

Sim7020E MAX Instantanous = 800mA @2.5V   Sleep mode = 3.4uA

STM32L431 MAX = 140mA        Sleep Mode = 0.3uA

If the System is running in its full capacity,
	Total Current = 970mA of Current.

If the system is running in sleep mode in the worst case
        Total current = 0.7mA


if a 5AH battery is used with an efficiency of 80%
	battery efficiency = 4AH
	for sleep mode it last for 150,000hrs
	Sleep mode battery time = 150,000hrs
	Sleep Mode in Days = 6,250days
	At least (5)years.

Battery of 1C rating
